# Reef_fish-
Spatial and temporal trends of reef fish 

The purpose of this project is to examine changes in reef fish distribution through time, and to determine what environmental factors are driving their distributions.  This project is part of my master's thesis.  Data is from the Southeast Reef fish survey (SERFS) data base.  
All data is located in the data folder.  The following files are in this folder: 
1. Raw Chevron Trap Data.csv- This is the raw data file that I started all of the analyses with.  
2. RawChevron.csv - Data file I created after selecting the columns I needed from the original raw data file. 
3. RawBSB.csv- raw black sea bass file I created by selecting only the variables of interest and creating a presence absence column. 
4. NewBSB.csv- limiting data to 2011-2015 and running na.exclude
5. RawWG.csv and NewWG.csv same as black sea bass but for white grunt
6. SpatialBSB.csv- adding habitat data to black sea bass data file
7. SpatialWG.csv- adding habitat data to white grunt data file
